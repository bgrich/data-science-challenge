The two questions that I have been asked to answer to the Room Key Data 
Science Challenge are: 

* What factors correlate with users booking? 
* What can Room Key do to increase booking conversion rate?

To begin, I want to do some exploratory data analysis to get a sense for the 
data.

# Data Import

The first step is to import the data to R. The data is stored as a tab-separated 
value format with three columns. The elements of each column contain an entry 
for referrals, leads, and booking in JSON format.
